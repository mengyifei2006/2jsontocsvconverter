        <h2>What is JSON?</h2>
        <p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.</p>

        <h2>What is CSV?</h2>
        <p>A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file is a plain text file that contains a list of data. These files are often used for exchanging data between different applications. For example, databases and contact managers often support CSV files. The format is very simple: each line is a data record, and each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format.</p>

        <h2>Why Convert JSON to CSV?</h2>
        <p><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> CSV is the standard format for most data analysis tools, including Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. Converting JSON to CSV allows you to easily import complex data into these tools for analysis, charting, and reporting.</p>
        <p><strong>Database Import:</strong> Many database systems, from traditional SQL databases to modern cloud-based solutions, offer bulk import features that work seamlessly with CSV files. This makes it a preferred format for migrating large datasets or performing bulk updates.</p>
        <p><strong>Readability:</strong> For simple, tabular data, a CSV file viewed in a spreadsheet application can be much easier for a non-developer to read, understand, and even manually edit compared to the nested structure of a JSON file.</p>
